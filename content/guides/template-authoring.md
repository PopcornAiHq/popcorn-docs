title: Authoring a channel template
summary: >
  A channel template is a directory of YAML that turns an empty channel into an application. This is the whole authoring loop: what a bundle holds, how it reaches a channel, the manifest keys, flow grammar and table schemas, and the traps. Where it disagrees with `flow validate` or `template check`, the tool is right and the guide has a bug.

A **channel template** is a directory of YAML that turns an empty Popcorn
channel into an application: tables to hold state, flows to do work, schedules
and webhooks to invoke them.

This guide is what you need that the API cannot tell you. It deliberately does
**not** list activities or their arguments — those come from the server and
would rot here:

```bash
popcorn flow activities --summary              # what can I call?
popcorn flow activities --name <wire.name>     # what do I pass it?
popcorn flow activities --json                 # full arg + result schemas
popcorn flow validate my_flow.yaml             # is this reference real?
popcorn template check ./mytemplate            # does the bundle hold together?
```

`flow validate` is the authority on a reference. When this guide and the
validator disagree, the validator is right and this guide has a bug.

`template check` answers a different question, offline and with no channel:
will the importer install what you think, and do the files agree with each
other? Everything it reports passes `flow validate` cleanly — a fixture named
`.yaml`, a write to an undeclared column, a schedule naming a flow that is not
there. Run both; neither subsumes the other.

Two bundles are referred to throughout, as the two ends of the choice §6 is
about:

| Bundle | Producers | Per-delivery cost |
|---|---|---|
| `alerttracker` | four, unrelated | one LLM call — it must *derive* severity and env |
| `deploywatch` | one (GitHub) | none — it *extracts* fields the payload states |

The gap between them is §6, and it is the single most consequential choice in
a webhook-backed template.
[`examples/alerttracker/GOTCHAS.md`](https://github.com/PopcornAiHq/popcorn-cli/blob/main/examples/alerttracker/GOTCHAS.md) is
the raw evidence log behind most of the rules below, and is worth reading
whole.

> **Do not copy a bundle out of this repo.** Cut-down copies of both live under
> `tests/fixtures/bundles/` and exist to exercise `template check`; neither
> declares a `version:`, so neither can publish, and both have drifted from
> what the platform actually ships. **Get bundle source from the server** — see
> §2b, where `app checkout` hands you the deployed version of a real one.

## 1. What a bundle is

```
mytemplate/
├── manifest.yaml        tables, schedules, webhooks, config, scalars
├── AGENT.md             notes injected into the channel agent's prompt
├── README.md            human docs (not installed as anything)
├── some_flow.yaml       one flow per file
└── fixtures/*.json      sample payloads — NOT installed (see §2)
```

Only `manifest.yaml` is meaningful on its own; everything else is optional. A
bundle with one flow and no manifest is a legal template.

## 2. How a bundle gets installed

**Two paths, and which one you are on depends on whether the app already
exists.** Creating a new app type still costs a server deploy. *Changing* one
is now entirely a CLI loop.

### 2a. A new app type — not self-serve

Only the first and last steps are yours. The two in the middle happen on the
Popcorn side and are not exposed through the CLI or the public API:

```
your bundle dir                                    (author here)
      │
      ├─▶ the new app type is registered and the workers
      │   that run its flows are deployed            (internal)
      │
      ├─▶ the bundle is published to the template registry
      │                                              (internal)
      │
      └─▶ popcorn channel create '#chan' --template <name>
```

**Publish after the deploy** — that ordering is the part worth carrying even
though you do not run either step. A bundle whose flows call a new activity
must not become installable before the workers that can run it exist: a channel
created from it inside that window installs cleanly and then fails on the first
run, with nothing to point at. Nothing enforces the ordering; it is release
discipline.

No public endpoint takes a *new* app off your disk. `channel create --template`
only resolves names the server already carries, so a genuinely new `app_type`
has to go through that internal path — and `popcorn channel templates` is how
you check whether it has landed.

### 2b. Changing an app that exists — `popcorn app`

A channel already running a bundle can be edited from the CLI, with no deploy
and no hand-off to anyone:

```bash
# fork onto this workspace's own line, then check its head out — one command
popcorn app checkout --channel '#chan' --fork
# ... edit
popcorn template check ./<app>
popcorn app publish ./<app> --bump patch -m "what changed"
popcorn app status ./<app>              # has the install landed?
```

`--bump patch|minor|major` writes `version:` in `manifest.yaml` for you, off
the fork line's head, and only once the publish has been accepted — so a
publish that fails leaves the working copy untouched and re-running the same
command is the retry. Editing `version:` by hand still works; `--bump` is
refused when the manifest already advances past the head, because counting
from the head would overwrite that number and counting from the manifest
would skip the versions in between. Reach for the flag or the hand edit, not
both in one publish.

`-m` records what changed on the version, exactly like `git commit -m`
(`--changelog` is the deprecated spelling and still works). **Note what it
does not do:** `manifest.yaml`'s own `changelog:` key is not read by a fork
publish — the server records the request's message and nothing else — so a
manifest that declares one while you pass no `-m` records nothing at all, and
publish says so. Nor is there any command that reads a published version's
message back: no endpoint serves it. The line `app publish` prints is the one
chance to see what landed.

The fork comes first and is not optional: a publish lands on a fork line **this
workspace owns**, so publishing from a channel still bound to the shared
product version is refused. `app publish` also starts the install that moves
your channel onto the new version, and that install converges on its own —
`app status` confirms it rather than causing it.

The bump is not optional either, and inside a checkout `template check` is
where you find that out. A published version is immutable, so `version:` must
strictly advance past the one the checkout came from; leaving it alone gets you
a `version-not-advanced` error offline instead of a server refusal after the
upload. Rewriting `changelog:` in the same edit is a warning
(`changelog-not-updated`) rather than an error, because the checkout arrives
carrying the *previous* version's note — so keeping it is the default outcome,
not an unlikely one. The warning says which job the field is doing for the line
you are on: in a fork checkout it is documentation that ships with the bundle
and `-m` is what records a note on the version, matching what `app publish`
tells you rather than contradicting it. Both checks read the baseline
`app checkout` wrote and are skipped entirely on a directory that is not a
checkout.

A checkout writes two files that are not bundle content: `.popcorn-app.json`,
the baseline above, and `CLAUDE.md`, which tells a coding agent opening a file
in the directory that this is a bundle and that an edit is not a release until
`template check` and `app publish` have run. Neither publishes. `CLAUDE.md` is
yours once written — a re-checkout leaves your edits to it alone unless you
pass `--force` — and it is not `AGENT.md`, which *is* bundle content and ships
to every channel that installs the app.

`app apply` is **not** a step in this loop. It is the retry for an install that
did not land: the channel had app updates locked, another install held it, or
it failed. Run it when `app status` says the channel is still behind its line,
not by habit.

**From outside a checkout**, `app status --channel <channel>` answers the same
question against server state alone — no working copy needed:

```bash
popcorn app status --channel '#chan'
popcorn app status --channel '#chan' --json | jq -r '.data.install_state'
```

`install_state` is `current` (the channel runs its fork line's head) or
`pending` (it does not). Poll that field rather than grepping a semver out of
`app list` output. One caveat worth knowing: the API exposes no status for the
install job itself, so `pending` cannot distinguish an install still running
from one that failed — `app apply --channel <channel>` is the retry for both.

`--fork` takes an optional line name (`--fork=experiment`); bare, it names the
line it is about to use and asks, because a workspace's single existing line
can be anywhere — one production line sat 23 minor versions behind product.
`-y` answers that. `popcorn app fork` on its own is still there and does the
same thing without the checkout.

**This is also how you read a real bundle.** `app checkout` returns the whole
tree — manifest, every flow, `AGENT.md`, `strings.yaml` — for the head of the
fork line the channel runs (normally the very version it is bound to; the two
differ only while an install has not landed), so it is the one source that
cannot be stale.
When you want to study how a shipped app does something, spend a scratch
channel on it rather than looking for a copy in a repo:

```bash
popcorn channel create '#scratch' --template alerttracker
popcorn app checkout --channel '#scratch'          # read it as it ships
popcorn app checkout --channel '#scratch' --fork   # ... or to edit it
```

Reading needs no fork — a fork-less checkout records `"kind": "product"` and
publishing from it is refused, which is the point. Fork when you intend to
edit, and note what that costs: a fork line is permanent and cannot be
deleted, so do it in a workspace you do not mind accumulating one in.
`popcorn app lines --channel <id>` is how you see what has accumulated.

Three things about this loop that are easy to get wrong:

- **`version:` in `manifest.yaml` must advance every publish.** Bundle versions
  only ever move forward; the CLI refuses a reused or lower number locally
  rather than letting the registry 409 at you.
- **A publish is not scoped to the channel you tested on.** Every other channel
  on the same fork line catches up on its own nightly auto-update tick.
- **One fork line per (workspace, app).** There is no parallel-experiment path
  without naming a second line (`app fork --name`).

`popcorn app list --channel '#chan'` shows the product line, any fork line this
workspace owns, and what the channel currently runs.

### The app list is filtered by your release track

`popcorn app list` and `popcorn channel templates` show what **your workspace's
release track** can see — alpha, beta or stable, per-workspace and defaulting
to stable. An app released only to alpha is invisible and uninstallable for a
workspace enrolled on stable.

**The API says nothing about why**, deliberately: enrollment is internal, and a
test enforces that it does not leak. So `channel create --template X` returns a
neutral 400 for an app your track cannot see, indistinguishable from a typo.
The CLI cannot diagnose this and does not try. If an app you know shipped is
missing from the list, that is the first thing to suspect — ask rather than
debug.

### What the reader does with your files

Two readers, one classification path: the registry reads your directory off
disk, and `read_zip` reads an uploaded archive (retained for a future upload
transport). Both then:

- **Reserves four names**: `manifest.yaml`, `AGENT.md`, `README.md`, and
  `strings.yaml` (client copy — `config.yaml` is a legacy manifest alias).
  Every template the backend ships has a `strings.yaml`.
- **Treats every other `.yaml` / `.yml` as a flow.** This is why fixtures must
  be `.json` — a sample payload named `.yaml` can be installed as a flow.
- **Descends `prompts/` and `templates/` only**, one level, seeding
  `$channel.prompts.<stem>` and `$channel.templates.<stem>`.
- **Descends `code/<block>/` to any depth** — one directory per custom code
  block, so a block may be a small package rather than a single file. The block
  name is a slug (it rides inside flow YAML as `code_name:`), and every segment
  below it must be visible: a hidden entry gets the tree refused at publish.
  Unlike the two directories above, files here are **not** seeded into channel
  config — `foundation.code.execute` reads them by block name at run time.
- **Silently skips everything else**, including dotfiles and `__MACOSX`.

A block file may carry any extension, `.yaml` included, and is block source
rather than a flow. `template check` reports `code-file-outside-block` for a
loose file directly under `code/` and `code-block-name-invalid` for a name that
is not a slug — both are trees `app publish` refuses.

Where they diverge — **keep the bundle flat and it never matters:**

| | registry (on-disk) | `read_zip` (archive) |
|---|---|---|
| `flows/a.yaml` | **ignored** — the dir is not descended | flattened to `a.yaml` |
| two files, same basename | both kept (different paths) | second one wins |
| entry over 1 MiB | no limit | rejected |

A nested flow is silently *dropped* by one reader and silently *flattened* by
the other. Neither tells you. `template check` flags the nesting.

**Flow identity is the `name:` inside the YAML, not the filename.** Install
upserts by name. Renaming `name:` creates a second flow and leaves the first
one installed — and install **prunes** flows the bundle no longer covers, so a
rename that you meant as a rename reads as one delete plus one create.

## 3. Manifest keys

Every key is optional. The install semantics differ per key and getting this
wrong is how you wipe a live channel's state.

| Key | Semantics | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `display_name`, `description` | catalog copy | for the template picker |
| `version` | bundle semver | **required to publish**; shape-validated when present |
| `app_type` | sets the channel's app | **see the warning below** |
| `tables` | **additive reconcile** | columns are added and attributes fixed, never dropped or renamed |
| `channel_parameters` | upsert, **types preserved** | read as `$channel.<name>` |
| `scalars` | **UPSERT on every install** | never put flow-written runtime state here |
| `default_scalars` | **write once, first install only** | safe place for an operator-owned switch |
| `schedules` | **REPLACE wholesale** | omitted = leave alone; `[]` = delete all |
| `webhooks` | **create-if-missing** | never updated or deleted |
| `triggers`, `connections`, `documents`, `status_kinds` | replace, omit-vs-empty | `[]` means "replace with nothing" |

The `*_declared` distinction runs through all of them: **an absent key leaves
the channel alone; a present-but-empty key means "replace with nothing."**
`schedules: []` deletes every schedule. Omitting `schedules:` does not.

> **An untyped bundle CLEARS the channel's `app_type`.** A manifest with no
> `app_type:` key strips whatever was there, which changes the client's whole
> interface paradigm. Never import an untyped bundle into a channel running a
> real app. `--dry-run` warns you.

### Runtime state must not appear under `scalars:`

`scalars:` upserts on *every* install. If a flow writes a `last_swept_at` key
and the manifest also declares it, every re-import resets it. Declare only
install-time configuration; let flows create their own runtime keys.
`template check` warns (`runtime-state-in-scalars`) when it sees a flow write
a scalar the manifest declares.

### Schedules address their own channel

Schedule `inputs` support two substitutions applied at install:
`<channel-conversation-id>` and `<workspace-id>`. That is how a portable
bundle passes its own channel's id into a scheduled flow.

```yaml
schedules:
  - flow: alert_tick
    slug: alert-tick
    interval: 300          # seconds; or cron: "0 8 * * *" + timezone:
    overlap: skip
    jitter: 30
    inputs:
      conversation_id: <channel-conversation-id>
```

## 4. Flow grammar

```yaml
name: my_flow             # identity — not the filename
version: 1
description: >
  What this does and why it is shaped this way.

inputs:
  conversation_id: { type: string }
  thing: { type: string, required: false, default: "" }

steps:
  - id: fetch
    activity: foundation.store.list_rows
    when: $inputs.thing != ''
    on_error: { policy: skip, retry: 1 }
    args: { ... }

  - id: each
    activity: foundation.store.patch_row
    foreach: $steps.fetch.output.rows
    as: row
    max_parallel: 1
    collect: patched
    args:
      record_id: $row._record_id

outputs:
  ids: $steps.fetch.output.rows
```

### Reference roots

| Root | Reads |
|---|---|
| `$inputs.*` | the run's declared inputs |
| `$steps.<id>.output.*` | a prior step's result |
| `$steps.<id>.<collect>` | a `foreach` step's collected list, under the name `collect:` gave it |
| `$channel.*` | channel config — parameters, scalars, and the seeded `integrations` / `integration_list` |
| `$trigger.*` | what triggered the run |
| `as:` name | the current item inside a `foreach` |

`$trigger` carries exactly `thread_id`, `message_id`, `user_id`,
`conversation_id`, `thread_root`, `contact_id`, `workflow_id`, `run_id` — a
closed set, so a typo in it is caught offline. Every key is always present; one
that does not apply to the run's trigger kind (`user_id` on a scheduled run,
say) resolves to null rather than erroring. `$channel` is not closed: its keys
come from a per-channel config the bundle cannot see, which is why an
unrecognized one is a warning.

**Every dot-separated segment starts with a letter or underscore** and then
carries only letters, digits and underscores. `$a.`, `$a..b` and `$a.1b` are
not references at all — they resolve as literal strings at runtime, which is a
silently wrong value rather than an error. A numeric segment is the one
exception and means an array index (`$steps.x.output.rows.0.title`).

**A `foreach` alias shadows every global root.** The interpreter resolves
aliases first, deliberately, so `as: channel` or `as: trigger` keeps working.

**Index arrays with dots, never brackets**: `$steps.x.output.ids.0`. Brackets
are rejected as malformed and would be treated as a literal string.

**A reference path is `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_.]*` — no spaces.** This matters
more than it sounds; see §5.

### `when:` has four rails, and the seam between two of them bites

Routing is **legacy-first**: a string the legacy parser accepts stays legacy
forever, even if it contains new-syntax tokens.

| Form | Rail | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `$ref` | legacy | truth-tested |
| `$ref == value`, `$ref != value` | legacy | **lenient** equality; a skipped step is `None` and compares unequal |
| anything with `&&` `\|\|` `<` `<=` `>` `>=` `!` `(` `)`, or a second comparison | expression | **strict, typed** |
| a plain literal | legacy | truthy as-is |

The expression grammar is `!`, `&&`, `||`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`,
parentheses; operands are `$ref`s, numbers, `true`/`false`, and quoted strings.
Precedence is parens → `!` → comparisons → `&&` → `||`. Bounds: depth ≤ 8, ≤ 32
conditions, ≤ 8 terms per chain, literals ≤ 1024 chars. No functions, no
arithmetic, no `${}` interpolation.

> **The seam.** A standalone `$a == 1` is *lenient* legacy equality; the same
> comparison inside `$a == 1 && $b != ''` is *strict and typed* on the
> expression rail. Adding a second condition can therefore change how the first
> one compares. And a string that routes to the expression rail but fails to
> parse is an **error** — never a fallback to literal truthiness.

`template check` does not police any of this: mirroring the routing rule
offline means reimplementing the predicate parser, and a near-miss
reimplementation reports valid clauses as broken (the earlier "one comparison
only" rule rejected 55 valid clauses across the shipped backend templates). It
checks the references inside a `when:` and leaves the grammar to `flow
validate`, which calls the real parser.

**Even so, prefer a query filter to a gate when you are selecting rows.** The
agent-store filter DSL runs in the database rather than after the fact:

```yaml
filter:
  Status: firing                                  # shorthand for $eq
  Last Seen: { $lt: $steps.cutoffs.output.iso }   # $gt $gte $lt $lte
  Nudged At: { $exists: false }                   # $in, $contains too
```

Ordering comparisons on ISO-8601 strings are correct because they are
lexicographic — in a filter *or* on the expression rail. The difference is
where the work happens: a filter selects rows in the database, while a `when:`
gate can only skip a step you already decided to run.

### `foreach`

`foreach:` takes a list, `as:` names the item, `collect:` names the result
list, `max_parallel:` bounds concurrency. A step-level `when:` on a `foreach`
step is **re-evaluated per item** in that item's scope, so `when: $row.Status
== 'firing'` filters items rather than skipping the whole step.

### A step is exactly one of four things

`activity:`, `sleep_seconds:`, `await_approval:`, or a nested `steps:` block.
Exactly one — the model rejects a step with two, or none.

Blocks nest three lists deep, counting the flow's own `steps:` as the first —
so a block inside a block is the deepest legal shape and a third level is
rejected. `template check` reports it as `block-too-deep`; without that you
would not hear about it until the install failed.

```yaml
  - id: maybe                     # a BLOCK: `when:` gates the whole group
    when: $steps.check.output.ok
    steps:
      - id: inner
        activity: foundation.channel.post
        args: { ... }
    outputs:
      posted: $steps.inner.output   # the ONLY thing outside can read
```

A block's scoping is the part worth internalizing:

```
outer step  ──▶ sees $steps.maybe.output.posted        ✅ (a declared output)
            ──▶ sees $steps.maybe.output.anything_else ❌
            ──▶ sees $steps.inner.*                    ❌ (private to the block)

inner step  ──▶ sees $inputs, $channel, $trigger, and every
                enclosing step at every level           ✅
```

Inner ids are private, so two blocks may reuse the same id. `outputs:` is
evaluated in the block's inner scope after its steps ran, and is legal only
alongside `steps:`. Omit it and the block publishes nothing — the same as a
skipped step.

`sleep_seconds:` is a durable timer (survives worker restarts, holds no worker
capacity) and cannot be combined with `foreach`. Neither can `await_approval:`,
which is a single blocking per-workflow gate — fanning it out would key every
iteration to the same signal.

### Errors and retries

Retry is flow-owned. **No `on_error` means up to 4 attempts** — any
non-idempotent step must set `retry: 0`. `policy: skip` continues the flow;
`policy: fail` stops it.

### There is no arithmetic

Nothing in the DSL adds, subtracts, counts, or compares magnitudes. There is
no expression syntax: you cannot write `$a + $b`, and you cannot even negate a
reference — `-$channel.minutes` is parsed as a literal string and fails type
validation. Consequences:

- **Never design a counter column.** Accumulate with a `merge: concat` string
  column and let readers count entries.
- **A sign cannot be applied by a step.** If an activity takes a *signed*
  value, the sign must be baked into the configured data — no step can flip
  it. Prefer an activity that names the direction as its own argument, which
  is why `math.offset` takes `direction: subtract` rather than a negative
  duration.

**Time windows are the exception, and they have a real activity.**
`foundation.math.offset` shifts a timestamp by a duration and returns
`workflow.now`'s `{unix, unix_str, iso}` shape, so its output drops straight
into a filter:

```yaml
  - id: cutoff
    activity: foundation.math.offset
    args:
      iso: $steps.now.output.iso     # omit to shift from now
      direction: subtract            # durations stay non-negative
      hours: 6

  - id: stale
    activity: foundation.store.list_rows
    args:
      filter:
        Last Seen: { $lt: $steps.cutoff.output.iso }
```

Pass `iso` explicitly when several cutoffs must derive from the same instant.
`alerttracker`'s sweep flow does exactly this, and is fully deterministic as a
result — it previously spent an LLM call per run on the subtraction.

## 5. Table schemas

Declared under `tables:` in the manifest; reconciled additively on every
import.

```yaml
tables:
  alerts:
    columns:
      - { name: Fingerprint, type: string, unique: true }
      - { name: Seen At, type: string, merge: concat }
      - { name: Raw, type: json, internal: true }
    merge_key:
      any_of: [Fingerprint]
      on_conflict: merge
```

`type` is `string | number | boolean | datetime | json`. `format` validates on
write; `display` only hints at rendering and is **never validated** — a
misspelled display arg fails silently by simply not rendering.

Governance flags (`pii`, `restricted`, `internal`, `passthrough`,
`masked_read`) are independent booleans. `internal: true` hides a column from
the user-facing UI — right for raw payloads and bookkeeping ids.

### Merge policy

Every column is `merge: replace` (last write wins). The **only** other mode is
`merge: concat`, which appends to a string column with a separator.

There is no "keep the existing value" policy. So a "first time we saw this"
column must never be written by the upsert — write it in a separate step gated
on `created == 1`, or every re-fire overwrites it.

`merge: concat` requires `type: string`. A timestamp history cannot be
`datetime`.

Check what is actually installed with:

```bash
popcorn table schema alerts --channel '#chan'
#   Seen At    string   [concat]
```

### Merge keys

`merge_key.any_of` columns must be **indexed** (`unique: true` satisfies it)
and **string-typed** — the OR-probe only queries the text index, so a
non-string merge key silently never matches.

### Name columns without spaces if a flow reads them

A column name may contain spaces if flows only ever *write* it (YAML map keys)
or *filter* on it (JSON keys). It must be space-free if any flow
**dereferences** it, because `$row.Last Seen` is not parseable:

```
steps[1](touch).args.text: malformed reference '$row.Last Seen'
```

Renaming later is not free — the installer is additive and never renames, so a
rename *adds* a column and orphans the old one.

**And the store accepts undeclared columns.** Writing `Post Message Id` when
the schema says `PostMessageId` silently succeeds and produces a column no
`$ref` can reach. Renaming a column means renaming every write site; only
reading a row back catches a miss.

## 6. Reading fields off an object input

The DSL cannot reach sub-fields of an `object` input — `$inputs.payload.name`
is statically unreachable, because an input declaration has no way to describe
an object's properties. To read fields off a webhook payload you must first
obtain a **typed** shape, and the only mechanism is an activity that declares
its output schema at the call site.

Two of those exist. **Reach for the deterministic one first.**

### `foundation.fields.extract` — when the fields are simply there

Names fields by path. No model, no prompt, and an absent path is an error
rather than a guess:

```yaml
  - id: fields
    activity: foundation.fields.extract
    args:
      data: $inputs.payload
      mapping:
        alarm: AlarmName
        service: Trigger.Dimensions.1.value    # dots for nesting AND indices
      defaults:
        note: ""                               # only for genuinely optional fields
      output_schema:
        type: object
        required: [alarm, service]
        properties:
          alarm: { type: string }
          service: { type: string }
```

`$steps.fields.output.alarm` then resolves statically, so `flow validate`
checks it. `deploywatch` is a whole bundle built this way — a single producer,
every field read by path, and not one model call in it.

Three behaviours worth knowing:

- **An unresolvable path fails the step** (`ExtractPathNotFound`), listing
  every bad path at once. That is the point — it is how a flow *requires* a
  field to be present rather than accepting something invented in its place.
  Posting a GitHub ping at `deploywatch`'s intake webhook returns exactly
  this, and writes nothing:

  ```
  ExtractPathNotFound: fields.extract could not resolve:
    creator <- deployment_status.creator.login;
    deployment_id <- deployment.node_id;
    environment <- deployment_status.environment; …
  ```

  Compare `agent.transform` given the same junk: it fabricates a row. The
  guard is structural here rather than a step you must remember to write.
- **`null` is a value, not an absence.** A stored null passes through; only a
  genuinely missing path errors.
- **The result is validated against `output_schema`** (`ExtractSchemaViolation`),
  so a value contradicting the type you declared fails here rather than in
  whichever later step consumes it.

### `foundation.agent.transform` — when the answer must be derived

Still the right tool when the payload does not *state* what you need — one
flow normalising several unrelated producers, a severity no field carries, a
human-readable title, prose. Judgement, not lookup.

The dividing line is worth applying literally, because it decides your risk:
extraction reads what is there, derivation invents what is not. A CloudWatch
alarm body has no `severity` and no `env` key at all, so those must be derived;
its `AlarmName` and `NewStateValue` are right there and should not be.

The two shipped examples are the same decision answered both ways, and the
input decides it, not taste:

| | `deploywatch` | `alerttracker` |
|---|---|---|
| producers | one | four, unrelated |
| identity | `deployment.node_id`, stated | `source:resource:env`, composed |
| environment | `deployment_status.environment`, stated | absent from a CloudWatch body — derived |
| tool | `fields.extract` | `agent.transform` |
| cost | none | one LLM call per delivery |
| junk input | fails, names every missing path | invents a plausible alert unless a `recognized` guard stops it |

Narrowing a bundle to one producer is therefore not just a scope decision —
it is what makes the deterministic tool available at all.

When you do need it, three rules, each paid for in a live failure:

**1. A required output schema is a formatting contract, not a validation
gate.** Given junk, the model *invents* a plausible object to satisfy
`required`, and `enum` merely constrains which lie it tells. Add an explicit
recognition flag and hard-stop on it:

```yaml
  - id: guard
    activity: foundation.workflow.fail
    when: $steps.normalize.output.recognized == false
    args: { reason: ..., code: UnrecognizedPayload }
```

**2. Every property you dereference must be in `required:`.** A declared-but-
optional property is genuinely optional — the model returned `details` on one
run and omitted it on the next, and a missing key is a hard failure:
`ReferenceError: $steps.normalize.output.details: key not found`.

**3. Keep the prompt and the schema consistent.** Telling the model to blank a
field whose `enum` excludes `""` is a contradiction, and it does not fail
cleanly — the model reasons about the conflict *in its output* and breaks JSON
parsing.

Finally, know which kind of transform you are writing. Mapping fields is
risky; **writing prose is not**. A digest whose wording drifts costs nothing,
because nothing downstream parses it.

## 7. The authoring loop

Three loops now, and picking the right one is most of the speed. The **inner**
loop is offline and runs as often as you like:

```bash
popcorn template check .                             # no channel, no server
popcorn flow activities --name <wire.name>           # what do I pass it?
popcorn flow validate my_flow.yaml                   # per file, fast
```

`flow validate` needs a channel only as an auth/context handle — any channel
you can reach will do; it never writes. Run from an `app checkout` and it
takes the channel from the checkout's baseline, the same way `app publish`
and `app status` do; pass `--channel <id>` anywhere else.

The **middle** loop is the fork loop from §2b, and it is the one to reach for
whenever the app already exists. No deploy, no hand-off, seconds per turn:

```bash
popcorn app publish ./<app> --bump patch -m "..."    # mint the next version
popcorn app status ./<app>                           # has the install landed?
popcorn app lines --channel <id>                     # what lines exist?
popcorn channel-config show --channel <id> --strict  # is the channel wired up?
popcorn flow runs list --channel <id>
```

`app lines` is the fork-line inventory — name, head semver, and when that head
was published — and it is worth a look before forking, because a nameless
`app fork` adopts whatever single line exists and the server refuses outright
once there are two. `--channel` there is the API's authorization handle, not a
filter: the lines listed are the workspace's. Two things it cannot tell you,
both because the API does not carry them: how many channels ride each line,
and how to delete one. Lines accumulate until the backend grows those.

`channel-config show` is worth running the first time a bundle installs: it
diffs every `$channel.*` reference your flows make against what the channel
actually has, and `--strict` exits non-zero on the three findings that make a
run fail — a referenced parameter that is not set, a declared integration that
is not connected, and a connected account whose provider contradicts a
declaration. The two `unused_*` findings are informational; a shared config
legitimately carries keys one flow does not read.

The **outer** loop is only for a NEW app type, and costs a server deploy plus
a publish (§2a), so get the inner one clean first:

```bash
# ... the app type is registered, deployed and published (§2a, internal)

popcorn channel templates                            # is my version installable?
popcorn channel create '#chan' --template mytemplate # note the UUID — see below

popcorn webhook list <id>                            # names and ids
popcorn webhook list <id> --show-url                 # + the ingest URL
popcorn webhook send Intake @fixtures/sample.json --channel <id>

popcorn flow runs list --channel <id>
popcorn flow runs get <workflow-id> --channel <id> --include-errors
popcorn flow runs cancel --flow <flow-name> --channel <id>   # stop every running run of a flow
popcorn table rows alerts --channel <id>
popcorn table schema alerts --channel <id>
```

Because the outer loop is expensive, a bundle that installs but is wrong costs
a whole deploy cycle to correct — which is the argument for `template check`
and `flow validate` being pedantic, and for exercising boundaries (below) the
first time you get a real channel rather than the third.

That argument is weaker than it was: once the app exists, a wrong bundle costs
a `app publish` rather than a deploy. It is not gone, though — the *first*
version of a new app still has to be right, and a fork publish still moves
every other channel on the line.

A freshly created channel is **not resolvable by `#name` for ~5 minutes**
(negative resolution caching). Use the conversation UUID immediately after
creating it.

`flow run` accepts a flow **name or UUID**, and defaults `conversation_id`
into the inputs from `--channel`:

```bash
popcorn flow run alert_tick --channel <id> --wait
```

Pass `--inputs` for a flow's own arguments; an explicit `conversation_id`
there always wins, so a flow can still target another conversation.

```bash
popcorn flow run seed_test_alert --channel <id> \
  --inputs '{"severity":"critical","env":"prod"}' --wait
```

### Checks will not save you

Every defect found while building the example bundle passed `flow validate`
cleanly, because they were runtime semantics rather than bad references: a
merge policy overwriting a first-seen timestamp, an LLM inventing a row, an
optional schema property going missing, a write to an undeclared column.

`template check` was written from that list and now catches the last two —
plus the whole class of cross-file mistakes a per-file validator cannot see:

```bash
popcorn template check .            # errors exit non-zero
popcorn template check . --strict   # warnings do too — this is the CI form
```

It cannot catch the first two. A merge policy is only wrong relative to what
you meant, and no offline tool knows an LLM is about to invent a row.

**So install it and run it.** `seed_test_alert.yaml` and
`seed_test_deploy.yaml` exist purely so a bundle can be exercised without a
real producer.

And exercise the **boundary**, not the happy path. A sweep that resolves
everything Completes just as cheerfully as a correct one; the only proof a
cutoff works is that a row just inside it moves and a row just outside it does
not. Both example bundles were verified that way.

Watch for these when reading results:

- Many activities have permissive result schemas (`additionalProperties:
  true`). For those, `$steps.x.output.anything` **passes validation and
  resolves to nothing at runtime**. Verify against the real response, not the
  catalog.
- `start_flow` is asynchronous. A parent that launches a child reports
  Completed immediately; check the **child's** run.
- Posting the same webhook body twice does not test your merge logic — the
  *webhook layer* dedupes identical deliveries and no flow runs at all. Vary
  the body while keeping the identity fields.
- A field that might be **absent** must never be dereferenced. A missing key
  is a hard `ReferenceError` that fails the run, and `on_error` does not
  rescue it — reference resolution happens before the activity is invoked.
  Guarantee presence upstream: in an `output_schema`'s `required`, or with
  `$exists: true` in the query that produced the rows.

## 8. Gotchas, condensed

1. `$inputs.<object>.field` is statically unreachable — get a typed shape
   first, with `fields.extract` when the fields are there and
   `agent.transform` when the answer must be derived.
2. `workspace_id` is never an input; it rides the auth context.
3. `scalars` UPSERT every install, `schedules` REPLACE wholesale,
   `default_scalars` write once. Runtime state belongs in none of them.
4. Flow identity is `name:`, not the filename.
5. Zips flatten to basenames, except `prompts/` and `templates/`. `code/`
   blocks are a tree-reader concept only — a zip carries no code blocks.
6. Webhook-triggered flows get `{conversation_id, payload, headers,
   source_hint, delivery_id, webhook_id}`, and only in `trigger_workflow` mode.
7. `<channel-conversation-id>` / `<workspace-id>` are substituted in schedule
   inputs.
8. No `on_error.retry` means up to 4 attempts.
9. Table changes are additive — never dropped, never renamed.
10. `app.*` activities are private to shipped apps. Author against
    `tier: foundation|feature`, `status: release`.
11. Scalars are strings on the wire; `channel_parameters` keep their types.
12. **No arithmetic anywhere**, and no negating a reference. Never design a
    counter; use `foundation.math.offset` for time windows.
13. **An untyped bundle CLEARS `app_type`.**
14. A `.yaml` anywhere in the zip becomes a flow. Fixtures are `.json`.
15. Permissive output schemas validate any path.
16. Index arrays with dots, never brackets.
17. `when:` is one `==`/`!=` comparison. Real predicates go in `filter`.
18. A column name with a space cannot be dereferenced.
19. The store accepts undeclared columns silently.
20. Every `output_schema` property you reference must be `required`.
21. A missing key is a hard `ReferenceError`, and `on_error` cannot rescue it —
    resolution precedes invocation. Guarantee presence in the query
    (`$exists: true`) or the schema (`required`).
